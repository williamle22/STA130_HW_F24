One place \"statistics\" can be used to decieve is through misuse of charts.  As discussed [here](https://handsondataviz.org/how-to-lie-with-charts.html) and many other places, a primary tactic that can be used to give a misleading impression using a chart is the manipulation of axes or the addition of additional dimensions which distort the meaning of size. **What are the problems with the following graphs?**\n",
